        <h1>Welcome to My Programming Portfolio</h1>
        
        <p> Hello All! <br>
            This website will be my first one and I will use it as a portfolio to hold all of the work <br>
            I will do for my class in CSC106 at the University of Rhode Island. On this website you will find <br> 
            work including codes from Javascript, some apps, and a small section about myself. Hopefully we will <br> 
            see the growth of a student interested in computer science that plans to take this long term. This <br>
            home page will be the heart of <em>all</em> the different appendages that will encase the future work <br>
            I will display in this class. <br>
