        <h1> About Me </h1>
        
        <p> You have just found my About Me page. <strong>Congratulations</strong>! I am a student <br>
            attending the University of Rhode Island. I had switched into the Computer Science B.S <br>
            major after being a Health Science major for a year. I grew up in Cranston, RI and attended <br>
            Cranston East High School. When I was a kid, I played baseball and that was up until <br>
            middle school where I then joined a dance academy. We went on to win some competitions<br>
            and I found it really enjoyable! I even joined two of the dance teams on campus my <br>
            freshman year. <br>
            <br>
        </p>
        <h2> Life On Campus! </h2>
            <img id="exposure" src="Exposure.jpg">
        <p> Like most students, I started out my college life by living on campus. I lived in a dorm, <br>
            shared trials and tribulations with my roommate, had a part-time job on campus, and joined <br>
            a few of the clubs here. Both of the clubs that I joined were dancing clubs where I could <br>
            continue doing Hip-Hop. The first one that I had joined was URI Dance Company. I am no longer <br>
            a part of that club, but I did have a good time there as everyone there is so nice. The second <br>
            club that I joined was the eXposure club. We did more that just Hip-Hop as it was a way to show <br>
            different styles of dancing throughout the world with a heavy focus on caribbean and afro dance <br>
            styles. I am currently the assistant choreographer where I help any person struggling to learn the <br>
            or I help the choreographers when they are stuck on creating the dance as well. The picture to the <br>
            right is the eXposure logo!

        <h2> Hobbies </h2>
             <img id="bass" src="bass.png">
              <p>Along with dancing, I also learned how to play an insturment in middle school. I had picked <br>
                 bass thinking it was the electric bass, but to my surprise it was the towering upright bass. <br>
                  There was nothing more confusing to me that day than seeing that! I eventually found to <br>
                  love it and I stuck with it until I graduated high school. In my sophomore year of high school <br>
                  I even went to a State Competition and I managed to make it into the orchestra
