        <h1> About Me </h1>
        
        <p> You have just found my About Me page. <strong>Congratulations</strong>! I am a student <br>
            attending the University of Rhode Island. I had switched into the Computer Science B.S <br>
            major after being a Health Science major for a year. I grew up in Cranston, RI and attended <br>
            Cranston East High School. When I was a kid, I played baseball and that was up until <br>
            middle school where I then joined a dance academy. We went on to win some competitions<br>
            and I found it really enjoyable! I even joined two of the dance teams on campus my <br>
            freshman year. <br>
            <br>
